### Development process

This project was developed with the Agile methodology which allowed us to develop the app iteratively and incrementally, and adapt changes with flexibility even in the late stages of development.

_GitHub Issues_ and _Projects_ are used to manage the development process.

The Project link: https://github.com/users/Erikas-Ramanauskas/projects/3

The GitHub _Kanban Board_ is used to manage the process and track the progress of the development. When User Story is created, it is automatically added to the Backlog column to be prioritized. The product Backlog is never complete, as it is a dynamic document to respond to changes effectively. As new features are identified, they are added to the product Backlog. As the product is released, the product Backlog is constantly updated to reflect changes in the product and changes in the market. The Kanban board includes the following columns:

- **Product Backlog** - the list of all \_User Stories that have not yet been scheduled to be completed. As new User Stories are created, they are automatically added to the Backlog column.
- **Sprint Backlog** - the collection of prioritized User Stories that have been selected for the current Sprint.
- **In Progress** - the user stories that are currently being developed.
- **Done** all completed and tested User Stories.

_Kanban Board_
![Kanban Board](docs/images/kanban-board.png)

The _Project Table_ is used to filter and prioritize _User Stories_.
At the start of each sprint, the _User Stories_ are selected from the _Product Backlog_ and added to the _Sprint Backlog_ with attached priority labels. The _User Stories_ prioritized using the MoSCoW method. The prioritization was based on the following criteria:

- **Must Have** - The _User Story_ is crucial and add significant value to the product and must be delivered in the current iteration.
- **Should Have** - The User Story is important but not critical to the success. Simply delivery is not guaranteed within the current iteration.
- **Could Have** - The _User Story_ is desirable and would only be delivered in their entirety in a best-case scenario. When a problem occurs and the deadline is at risk, one or more could-have items are dropped.
- **Won't Have** - The _User Story_ will not be delivered in the current delivery timebox but may be considered for the future. The prioritization is based on the 60-20-20 rule where 60% of the effort is spent on the _Must Have_, 20% on the _Should Have_ and the rest 20% on the _Could Have_.

## UX Design

All aspects of the UX design flow directly from the fact that the goal is the creation of a browser based game. From the moment the user navigates to the website the user should feel that they are now playing a game. Therefore the landing page does not have a navigation bar and footer typical of most information provision type sites. Instead it has a button based ‚Äúgame menu‚Äù. The menu is positioned front and centre and the user options are simple and clear. The second element is the inclusion of a colourful background in keeping with the theme of the site. This colourful theme simple navigation is repeated throughout. The pages containing the game rules and creator information continue this approach. The game itself is contained across 2 pages. These continue the overall design approach but contain increased imagery and colour. The aim is to clearly let the user know that they are now in the game proper and also to achieve the goal of providing elements to explore.

## UI Design

### Fonts

The font used is "Shadows Into Light" from Google Fonts and was chosen to reflect the spooky, Halloween, witches theme while maintaining readability. Other somewhat more stylised and potentially suitable fonts were also trialled but it was considered that readability was compromised.

### Colours

Much of the colour on the site is generated using a careful choice of background images. These images have been chosen to provide consistency across the site and consist largely of blacks, purples, reds, oranges and browns that were considered to have an autumnal/Halloween feel.
Where colours are applied to fonts and backgrounds these have been chosen to remain consistent with the chosen images and the overall theme.
In particular:

- The Witches Brew title is in white (#ffffff) to provide contrast with the colourful background.
- #eca72c, an orange colour has been used for card and button backgrounds.
- #f0c478, a lighter orange colour has been used for hover over buttons.
- #504069, a purple colour has been used for some text including the creator‚Äôs cards.
- #212529, a black colour has been used for some text including button texts.

### Sounds

Short sounds such as a witches cackle have been used to add to the game atmosphere. These were sourced from <a href="https://freesound.org/">Freesound</a>.

### Images and Animations

Images have been used to provide much of the colour for the site as outlined above. They are also used to create specific components of the game play. ChatGPT has been used to create some images and others have been sourced from freepik.com and attributed in the credits below.

### Wireframes
